## Description
This API provides the back end for a social network application. It holds a User model, a Thought model, and a Reaction schema so that users may join the site, make friends, make 'thoughtful' posts to their friends, and they can respond to these thoughts by posting reactions. 
Here is a link to a walkthrough video to show how to run this application.
